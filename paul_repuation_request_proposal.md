Hi Genesis DAO community, my name is Paul Pounendis, current President of Adelaide Blockchain, a 15+ student run organization!
We run lectures, workshops, bootcamps, many events and soon student projects to engage the students and community on Blockchain technology!

I would like to participate in the Genesis DAO, and learn how our potential initiatives would benefit others in the community. 
I have learnt about this from my great friend Daniel Bar, who said this would be a great fit for us!
